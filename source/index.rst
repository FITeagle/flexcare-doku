Welcome to FLEXCARE's documentation!
====================================

The FLEXCare project aims to extend the existing testbed facilities from the FLEX project. This documention contains detailed information on how the LTE part of the FUSECO Playground is integrated into the FLEX architecture.

..This documentation describes the setup for accessing the `FUSECO Playground <http://www.fuseco-playground.org>`_ can be accessed through its different interfaces for the FLEXcare project.
.. The focus lies on the users, not on technologies.
.. Therefore, the documentation should allow users first to be able to access resources the most simple way (e.g. via SSH).
.. Then, different other access technologies are being described (such as 
.. `FIRE <http://fed4fire.eu>`_/`GENI <http://geni.net>`_, 
.. `FI-PPP <http://xipi.eu>`_ or 
.. `EIT <http://testbeds.eu>`_ API's).
